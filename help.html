            <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
            <p>
                You are playing the character of your ex. She is
                a vegan on diet and will eat only apples. Help her eat 
                more and more apples and if you have any grudge. You can make her
                collide with the walls. Ofcourse, Game will end there. <br><br>
                But.... <br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong><big>Easy:</big></strong> Your ex will be slow and less prone to accidents. Not very close to reality as things will be under your control. There will be no obstacles...</li>
                <li><strong><big>Normal:</big></strong> Just a normie game noone would like to play. A life without thrill is not worth living. Just a few obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong><big>Hard:</big></strong> Your ex is very very fast. Just like how fast and cunning she was in real life. Things will be out of your control. Sounds Familiar? Obstacles? *Demonic laughter*</li>
